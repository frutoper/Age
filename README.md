### NHL's January Birday Pattern Begins in Juniors

Fifteen-year-old hockey players born in January are seven and a half times more likely to be drafted to Juniors than players born in October, November, or December. This insane statistic came out of the recent Western Hockey League (WHL) Bantam Draft (recently featured on Deadspin). Of the 228 players drafted, 53 (23%) were born in January. If birth month had no effect on whether a player was drafted or not then each month would have about 19 players drafted (the red line in the graph below). Instead the results are heavily skewed toward the beginning of the year.
